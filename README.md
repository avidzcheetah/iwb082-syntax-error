This Ballerina program is a Weather Notification Service that allows users to subscribe to receive weather updates via email. Users can sign up by providing their email address, and the program will regularly check the current weather from an external API. If certain conditions, like rain, are detected, the program automatically sends an email alert to all subscribed users, keeping them informed of significant weather changes. The program runs this check periodically to ensure timely notifications.
